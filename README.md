Here, I come up with my own answears to the some very interesting problems using primarly Pandas, Data Cleaning and Data Visualization.

The exercises are loosely divided in sections. Each section has a difficulty rating; these ratings are subjective, of course, but should be a seen as a rough guide as to how elaborate the required solution needs to be.

## Overview of puzzles

| Importing pandas  | Getting started and checking your pandas setup  | Easy |
| DataFrame basics  | A few of the fundamental routines for selecting, sorting, adding and aggregating data in DataFrames  | Easy  |
| DataFrames: beyond the basics  | Slightly trickier: you may need to combine two or more methods to get the right answer  | Medium |
| DataFrames: harder problems  | These might require a bit of thinking outside the box...  | Hard |
| Series and DatetimeIndex  | Exercises for creating and manipulating Series with datetime data  | Easy/Medium |
| Cleaning Data  | Making a DataFrame easier to work with  | Easy/Medium |
| Using MultiIndexes  | Go beyond flat DataFrames with additional index levels  | Medium |
